- 👋 Hi, I’m Tom Maltby, @MaltbyTom
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in updating my coding skills after 15 years out of the industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, starting with a Pygame project built around the aesthetic of 80's arcade games.
- 💞️ Eventually, I’m looking to collaborate on more opensource projects, potentially including Gimp features.
- 📫 Feel free to email me at tom@maltby.org
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've spent the last 15 years making mead, a wine-strength alcohol made from honey.  Before that, my
- primary career was industrial control and measurement software, with side contracts in business software databasing,
- graphic design, and web presence / content generation for various clients.

I have added my first Pygame project.  I had 2 hours of fooling with Python last Summer, and otherwise hadn't
ever spent time with it, but I used to learn new languages frequently.  This is a gif from the product of the first 40
hours spent on the project, learning python and coding; all the time I could steal over one weekend.
